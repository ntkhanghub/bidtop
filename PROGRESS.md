## Task log
<!-- Newest first. One line: date · task ID · outcome · commit/PR if any -->
- 2026-08-24 · S1-T7 done, Sprint 1 complete · User connected the GitHub repo to Vercel, added
  `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`/`NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`/`SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` as Vercel
  env vars. Production build of commit `cd3b8ae` succeeded (Next.js 16.3.2/Turbopack, TypeScript
  check passed, page data collection against the real Supabase DB succeeded). All of Sprint 1's
  Definition of Done items are met except final user review.
- 2026-08-24 · Repushed to GitHub with corrected commit authorship · user deleted and recreated
  `github.com/ntkhanghub/bidtop`, then asked to rewrite all 5 existing local commits' author from
  `ntkhang888@gmail.com` to `ntkhang@gmail.com` before the first push (safe — nothing had been
  shared yet at the time... except origin/master turned out to already have identical content,
  apparently pushed independently via another session/device, e.g. Remote Control on mobile).
  Confirmed via `git fetch` before touching anything. Rewrote all 5 commits with
  `git rebase --root --exec 'git commit --amend --author=...'`, then `git push --force` after
  explicit confirmation (force-push flagged and confirmed separately, since it overwrote existing
  remote content). `origin/master` now matches local exactly, all commits show
  `Khang Nguyen <ntkhang@gmail.com>` as both author and committer.
- 2026-08-24 · S1-T6 re-verified against supabase-js data layer · Fixed missing GRANT statements in
  `20260823_init.sql` (tables created by `prisma` role weren't accessible to `service_role` —
  added `GRANT ALL ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO service_role` and `GRANT SELECT ON
  categories, listings, settings TO anon, authenticated`). Re-applied migration + seed. `npm test`,
  `npm run build` (ISR revalidate:30s confirmed), `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck` all pass.
  Live browser: homepage shows empty-state "Chưa có listing nào được duyệt" from real Supabase DB.
  Not yet committed.
- 2026-08-23 · Data layer switched Prisma → `@supabase/supabase-js` (mid-Sprint-1 pivot; see
  Decisions for the reasoning) · Rebuilt from scratch: `supabase/migrations/20260823_init.sql`
  (raw SQL — tables, enums, indexes, RLS policies, `increment_listing_amount()` RPC function with
  `EXECUTE` revoked from anon/authenticated) applied via `scripts/apply-migration.mjs`;
  `supabase/seed.sql` applied via `npm run db:seed`; `lib/supabase/server.ts` (service-role client)
  + `lib/supabase/database.types.ts` (hand-written `Database` type — hit and fixed a real bug here:
  postgrest-js's `GenericSchema`/`GenericTable` types require `Views` and `Relationships` keys even
  when empty, or `.select()` silently infers `never`); `app/page.tsx` rewritten against the new
  client. Removed `prisma`, `@prisma/client`, `@prisma/adapter-pg`, `pg` (moved to devDependency,
  now dev-tooling-only), `prisma.config.ts`, `prisma/` entirely. Verified for real, not just
  typechecked: `scripts/verify-atomic-increment.mjs` fired 8 concurrent RPC calls at one listing
  and confirmed the final amount was the exact sum of all deltas (no lost update) — the single most
  important correctness property in the whole system. `npm run lint`/`typecheck` clean.
  `npm test`/`npm run build`/live-browser homepage check still pending — need
  `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`/`NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`/`SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` from the
  user (`DATABASE_URL`/`DIRECT_URL` alone, which we have, aren't enough — those only feed the dev
  migration script now, not the app). Not yet committed.
- 2026-08-23 · S1-T3 re-verified on the Singapore project · user recreated the Supabase project in
  `ap-southeast-1` (project ref `fugvcufgrpnnanqxmvrs`, replacing the Seoul one). Same pooler
  hostname gotcha hit again, this time with two candidate clusters (`aws-0-` and `aws-1-` both
  resolved via DNS) — tried `aws-0-ap-southeast-1.pooler.supabase.com` first and it was correct.
  `migrate dev`, `db seed`, `npm test`, `npm run build`, and live-browser homepage check all
  re-run clean against the new DB.
- 2026-08-23 · S1-T3/T4/T5/T6 done (Seoul, superseded above) · Real Supabase project connected. Fixed a wrong pooler
  hostname along the way (missing `aws-0-` prefix — see Decisions). `prisma migrate dev` applied
  migration `20260823073758_init` cleanly; `prisma db seed` inserted 21 categories + 3 settings;
  homepage verified live in-browser showing the real DB-sourced empty state; `npm run build`
  succeeds with ISR `revalidate: 30s` confirmed in the build output. Not yet committed (env file
  itself is gitignored as expected; migration SQL + doc updates pending commit).
- 2026-08-23 · S1-T4 (partial: schema only) · `prisma/schema.prisma` written for
  categories/listings/bids/settings/admin_users per tech-spec; validated with `prisma
  validate`/`generate` against a placeholder `.env`. Commit `9833000`.
- 2026-08-23 · S1-T5 (partial: script only) · `prisma/seed.ts` written with the 21 categories +
  default settings. Commit `9833000`.
- 2026-08-23 · S1-T6 (partial: code only) · `app/page.tsx` queries
  `listings WHERE status = 'approved' ORDER BY amount DESC, firstConfirmedAt ASC` with an empty
  state, `revalidate = 30` (ISR). Commit `9833000`.
- 2026-08-23 · S1-T2 done · CLAUDE.md Commands section updated to the real, verified commands
  (dev/build/lint/typecheck/test/format/prisma generate/migrate dev/db seed). Commit `9833000`.
- 2026-08-23 · S1-T1 done · Scaffolded with Next.js 16.3.2 + Tailwind v4 + sonner + Vitest +
  Prettier; merged into repo root, `git init`, first commit. Verified live in-browser (not just
  lint/typecheck): Tailwind computed styles applied, test toast fired and rendered. Commit
  `9833000`.

## Decisions
<!-- Date · decision · why, one line each. Deviations from the specs are recorded here AND
reflected back into the spec file. -->
- 2026-08-23 · Payment gateway = 9Pay (not VNPay/Momo/ZaloPay/Stripe) · team already has a working
  integration on ContentSuper.com.
- 2026-08-23 · Guest checkout only (no user accounts) for MVP · matches outbid.lol's model,
  minimizes friction.
- 2026-08-23 · New listings require manual admin approval before appearing publicly; top-ups on
  already-approved listings do not · balances content safety against the "pay = rank now" value
  prop, since content only needs vetting once.
- 2026-08-23 · Starting price 100,000đ, minimum increment 50,000đ, VAT 8% added at checkout on top
  of the ranked amount · configurable at runtime by super_admin via Settings, not hardcoded.
- 2026-08-23 · Launch category list finalized at 21 categories (see
  `docs/sprints/sprint-01-foundation.md` S1-T5) · corrected from an initial "19" mislabel during
  kickoff — the itemized list the user approved actually totals 21.
- 2026-08-23 · Database = Supabase Postgres (not Neon) · user's explicit choice; only its Postgres
  product is used, not Auth/Storage/Realtime. Still true after the later Prisma → supabase-js
  switch below — this decision was about the *database*, not the client library.
- 2026-08-23 · Styling = Tailwind CSS, transient feedback = toast notifications (sonner chosen as
  the default library, swappable) · user's explicit choice.
- 2026-08-23 · "Claim this rank for X" pricing shortcut added (F1, S5-T2) · user shared an
  outbid.lol screenshot showing this exact UI pattern: clicking a leaderboard row pre-fills
  `/submit`'s amount with that row's current amount + `min_increment`. Also resolves the earlier
  open question about a special higher threshold for rank #1 — confirmed there isn't one; #1 uses
  the same formula as any other rank.
- 2026-08-23 · Manual admin review reconfirmed for new listings (not reverting to outbid.lol's
  instant-publish) · user's explicit call — avoids the platform being blindsided by
  politically-sensitive content going live unreviewed. F6/F8 unchanged, no spec edit needed.
- 2026-08-23 · Scaffolded with Next.js 16 (not 15) and Tailwind v4 (not v3) · both were "latest
  stable" at scaffold time; tech-spec always intended boring/latest, not a hard version pin.
  CLAUDE.md and tech-spec.md updated to match. No `tailwind.config.ts` exists — v4 doesn't need
  one for this project.
- 2026-08-23 · **Superseded** — Prisma 7's schema.prisma no longer accepts `url`/`directUrl` in the
  datasource block · was true and relevant while Prisma was in use (S1-T3 era); moot after the
  Prisma → supabase-js switch further down this list. Left here only as a record of what was
  investigated at the time.
- 2026-08-23 · Homepage (`app/page.tsx`) uses ISR (`revalidate = 30`), not pure static or
  force-dynamic · matches tech-spec's NFR ("leaderboard renders < 1s on the cached path") while
  keeping listings reasonably fresh after a payment. Means `npm run build` needs a real DB
  connection to prerender `/` — expected, not a bug.
- 2026-08-23 · Supabase DB role = dedicated `prisma`-named role (not default `postgres`
  superuser), kept as dev-tooling role after the Prisma → supabase-js switch · originally followed
  Supabase's official Prisma integration guide (least privilege); the name is now a legacy
  artifact but the role itself is still correct for `scripts/apply-migration.mjs`'s job. Created
  with `bypassrls` explicitly, so it's unaffected by "Automatic RLS on new tables" either way.
- 2026-08-23 · Supabase project recreated in `ap-southeast-1` (Singapore) · resolves the earlier
  Seoul-vs-Singapore open question — user chose to switch. No real data existed yet, so the old
  Seoul project's data was simply abandoned, not migrated.
- 2026-08-23 · Fixed wrong Supabase pooler hostname (twice — Seoul project, then Singapore
  project) · `[region].pooler.supabase.com` doesn't resolve (NXDOMAIN) — needs a pooler cluster
  prefix, e.g. `aws-0-[region].pooler.supabase.com`. **The cluster number isn't always `aws-0`** —
  on the Singapore project both `aws-0-ap-southeast-1` and `aws-1-ap-southeast-1` resolved via DNS
  as distinct clusters; `aws-0` happened to be the correct one for this project, verified by
  actually connecting, not assumed. If a future project's connection fails the same way, check
  both. `.env.example` corrected to flag this explicitly.
- 2026-08-23 · **Data access layer switched from Prisma to `@supabase/supabase-js`, entirely
  replacing the ORM** · user's explicit, informed choice — asked directly after Prisma was already
  built, working, and verified against a live DB in Sprint 1. Before agreeing to touch anything,
  walked through why the project originally chose direct-Postgres-via-server over
  `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` + client-side Supabase SDK (the anon-key pattern shifts all
  enforcement onto RLS policies the browser can reach directly; a direct server-only connection
  means the browser never holds any DB-reaching credential at all — stronger default for an app
  with a password-hash table and a payment ledger) — user acknowledged this and asked to switch
  anyway, then picked the most disruptive of 4 offered scoping options ("replace Prisma entirely")
  over 3 narrower ones (keep Prisma + add anon key for one feature; server-only Supabase SDK
  without any anon key/RLS surface at all; do nothing).
  **What changed:** raw SQL migrations (`supabase/migrations/`) applied by a small local script
  instead of `prisma migrate`; hand-written TS types instead of Prisma-generated ones; the atomic
  rank-engine write became a Postgres RPC function (`increment_listing_amount`, `EXECUTE` revoked
  from anon/authenticated) instead of Prisma's `increment()` inside a `$transaction`; RLS enabled
  on every table with exactly 3 narrow public read policies (categories, approved listings,
  settings) — everything else (all writes, `bids`, `admin_users`) has zero policies, reachable only
  via `service_role` from server code.
  **What did NOT change:** the security model itself. All app traffic — including the public
  homepage — still goes through `service_role` server-side; `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` is
  configured (as the user asked) but nothing calls it yet, so it grants nothing in practice today.
  The browser still never holds a credential that reaches the database. RLS exists as a second,
  currently-mostly-inert layer in case that ever changes by accident, not because the app relies on
  it today.

## Blockers & open questions
<!-- Anything a session had to stop on, waiting for user input. -->
- 9Pay merchant credentials: new account for BidTop.vn, or reuse ContentSuper.com's? Must resolve
  before Sprint 3 (see tech-spec.md Open questions).
- bidtop.vn domain/trademark availability not yet confirmed — must resolve before Sprint 6.
- Legal review of "Dịch vụ pháp lý" and "Crypto, Web3 & Investing" categories not started — both
  stay out of the product indefinitely until done (no sprint assigned).
